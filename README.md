AnalyticsVidhya- Game of Deep Learning: Computer Vision Hackathon

Problem Statement
Ship or vessel detection has a wide range of applications, in the areas of maritime safety, fisheries management, marine pollution, defence and maritime security, protection from piracy, illegal migration, etc.

Keeping this in mind, a Governmental Maritime and Coastguard Agency is planning to deploy a computer vision based automated system to identify ship type only from the images taken by the survey boats. You have been hired as a consultant to build an efficient model for this project.

There are 5 classes of ships to be detected which are as follows:

Dataset Description
There are 6252 images in train and 2680 images in test data. The categories of ships and their corresponding codes in the dataset are as follows -

'Cargo' -> 1
'Military' -> 2
'Carrier' -> 3
'Cruise' -> 4
'Tankers' -> 5
